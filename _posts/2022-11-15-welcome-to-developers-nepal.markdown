Developers Nepal is an online space for developers, technologists and enthusiasts to connect and spread the love of technology in Nepal. This group is for, and by, the people who love sharing knowledge and working together to create a better online environment. If you think you love technology and are even remotely connected to Nepal, we welcome you to join us!

This page is a general introduction to Developers Nepal (DN) along with set of rules and guidelines so that everyone feels welcome to be part of this large community. These rules also apply to all the DN subgroups, although they can extend it to better accommodate their own community.

## About Developers Nepal

The many technology groups in Nepal are scattered all over the inter-web. Finding like-minded people to network and discuss is complex. It always will be.

Developers Nepal (DN) is a medium to unify Nepalese developers across the world. It acts as a link to all the developer communities in Nepal. It serves as a platform to share ideas and knowledge that any good developer might find interesting. Nothing can be more greater than a unified whole where one can learn from the other.

## Rules, Guidelines & Tips

DN is a community. People participating in DN have different views and interests. These rules are set in place so that DN maintains its positive and vibrant environment. If you think any of the rules/guidelines don’t cover something important, please contact any one of the group admins.

(Most of the rules and guidelines are heavily inspired and taken from Hackathon Hackers and some from Hacker News. Communities help each other.)

## Rules

- Do not post anything racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, or in any other way demeaning toward anyone. No exceptions.

- Do not post anything utterly irrelevant to the group or subgroup.

- Do not call out names or be rude. When disagreeing, keep your post about the topic. E.g. “That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3.” can be shortened to “1 + 1 is 2, not 3.”

- Do not spam. This includes writing in uppercase for emphasis or using link-bait headlines.

## Guidelines

Whenever you post or reply, there are other people sitting behind the screen reading what you say. These other people have thoughts, ideas, dreams, aspirations, troubles, advice, perspectives, feelings, and experiences, just like you. You’ll probably end up meeting a lot of them if you go to an event. Everyone in this group is a potential new friend, business partner, co-founder — treat them that way.

As a general discussion rule: when you can, please do take the time to educate your fellow developer, for the betterment of the community. Getting extremely offended over every trivial thing, passive-aggressive sniping, and general unpleasantness is unwelcome; thoughtful, productive discussion is welcome entirely.

A good way to get involved is to start a thread about something you’re interested in. Chances are, with this many people in the group, someone else is bound to be excited to talk about your favorite library/program/website/language. Jump in!

## Tips
Sharing your personal projects is totally allowed, as long as it isn’t spammy. Please share your app or website that you’re working on, or any design that you find interesting. There are groups exclusively for this: DN: What Are You Working On?, DN: Design.

There are Nepalese all around the globe. Want to collaborate with people around you? Try looking for communities specific to the country you live in e.g. DN: USA or DN: India. If you don’t find what you are looking for, create one!

## Be a moderator

Leadership is highly encouraged within the DN community. We understand that leaders with new ideas will help the community grow and be more sustainable. If you feel that you have what it takes to nurture and grow a community of geeks, please contact one of the group moderators. One of the moderators will get in touch with you as soon as possible.
